Samsung Nears Apple Profit Level	"Apple and Samsung Electronics are sucking up every penny of profit in the handset business. But Samsung’s mobile business is growing fast, and the question is: Could it surpass Apple in profit next quarter?
 
Analysts at Canaccord Genuity, an investment research firm, think so, according to a new report. The report, issued on Monday, said that in the first quarter of the year, Apple took 57 percent of profit in the handset business, while Samsung took 43 percent. That shows substantial growth for Samsung’s phones. For comparison, in the first quarter last year, Apple raked in 74 percent of profit, and Samsung took 26 percent."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DEEDC1638F930A25756C0A9659D8B63

Beware Calls To Settle Debt	"It may sound like a solution: You are mired in debt and a telemarketer calls, offering to help reduce the amount you owe, in exchange for a fee.
 
But consumers should be very wary of such calls, said Claire Rosenzweig, president and chief executive of the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York. “If someone just willy-nilly calls you and says they can reduce your debt, just don’t do it,” she said. The better choice is to hang up and do your own research about the legitimate resources that are available to help you, she said. Then, you can initiate your own call, once you are comfortable with an agency’s credentials."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E3DB1438F932A25756C0A9659D8B63

New Phone By Facebook To Showcase Its Network	"8:45 p.m. | Updated Facebook users post more photos, write more status updates and hit the like button more often from mobile devices than they do from computers.

On Thursday, Facebook plans to unveil the first smartphone created to showcase its social network. The phone, made by HTC, uses a version of Google’s Android software, according to two people briefed on the announcement, which will be made at a news conference at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E1D6123DF933A05750C0A9659D8B63
Insuring Pets May Not Pay	"Decisions about end-of-life care for pets are heart-wrenching for their owners. That’s even more so now than 10 or 20 years ago because new technology and advances in medical treatments have made their way down to pet care, meaning there are more ways to save or extend your pet’s life. But it also means more expense, if you choose to do so. 
 
Here are some questions to consider."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DD1E3AF933A05750C0A9659D8B63
One Number at a Time	"I think it’s true that if I want to improve my performance in something, I need to measure and track it.

When performance is measured and reported back, the rate of improvement accelerates.”
 
I’ve certainly seen this in my life. It’s pretty amazing the difference it makes in my exercise habits when I can see on my watch how far I’ve gone and how fast I’m running. Just a little feedback sharpens my focus."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DB103AF933A05750C0A9659D8B63

Ms. Porat, above, decided to take her name out of the running in part because she did not want to face questions about her finances and was worried about a highly charged environment in Washington against bankers, according to these people.

DEAL UNDER FIRE An influential proxy advisory firm, Institutional Shareholder Services, has recommended that shareholders of MetroPCS reject a proposed merger with T-Mobile USA. I.S.S. largely agreed with major shareholders — including Paulson & Company and P. Schoenfeld Asset Management — who have objected to both the debt that the merger would place on the combined company and the stake that MetroPCS shareholders would own of the new entity. Both have called for either better terms or for the service provider to remain independent. T-Mobile’s chief executive, John Legere, above, had earlier attacked both investors obliquely, referring to them as “greedy hedge funds.” MICHAEL J. de la MERCED"	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E1DF123DF93AA15750C0A9659D8B63

On Thursday, in something of a surprise, Mr. Zucker named Ms. Bolduan the co-host of CNN’s forthcoming morning show, which has attracted considerable interest in the television business this year, given Mr. Zucker’s past life as a former producer of NBC’s “Today” show."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E7D8143DF93AA15750C0A9659D8B63

F.A.A. May Relax Rules On Fliers&#x2019; Use of Devices	"If you’re sitting on a plane at the gate and reading this column on an electronic gadget, you’re about to hear eight dreaded words: “Please power down your electronic devices for takeoff.” But this time next year, you might hear something very different: “Please put your devices on ‘airplane mode’ for takeoff.”
 
According to people who work with an industry working group that the Federal Aviation Administration set up last year to study the use of portable electronics on planes, the agency hopes to announce by the end of this year that it will relax the rules for reading devices during takeoff and landing. The change would not include cellphones."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E5DE133AF936A15750C0A9659D8B63
ABC Asks Fans to Save a Show	"The impulse among television superfans to create “save our show” campaigns for every imperiled sitcom and drama has been co-opted by one of the very networks that shows have to be saved from.
 
“Friday, March 29, you can save ‘Happy Endings,’ ” intones ABC’s new commercial for the low-rated sitcom. A graphic at the beginning of the ad has the word “SAVE” in bright red letters."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E3D8133AF936A15750C0A9659D8B63
A Magazine Article on Race Sets Off an Outcry	"Few subjects appear to provoke from readers as much debate, and anger, as race does. Since Philadelphia Magazine published its article “ Being White in Philly : Whites, race, class, and the things that never get said” in late February, it has drawn a public rebuke by the city’s mayor, the threat of a boycott by the local African-American Chamber of Commerce and at least two forums where the magazine’s editor and the article’s writer answered angry questions.
 
Controversy clearly can be good for business. The magazine, whose circulation has declined nearly 10 percent in the last five years, according to the Alliance for Audited Media, had a minor boom in sales from the issue. Tom McGrath, the editor, said the article generated 1.4 million page views, a milestone for the site. The article has over 6,000 comments online, and Mr. McGrath said several vendors told the magazine that they sold out of the issue and wanted more copies."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E2D8133AF936A15750C0A9659D8B63

Using Cards&#xd; For Car Debt	"The credit card site CardHub.com recently reviewed current zero-balance credit card transfer offers and found that many cards let consumers transfer all sorts of debt — not just credit card debt — onto the new cards.
 
The site’s founder Odysseas Papadimitriou , writing about the findings for The Christian Science Monitor, said several major card issuers let you transfer car loans to their credit cards — in effect, letting you trade secured debt (the car is collateral for the loan) for unsecured debt. Some cards have introductory zero interest rate periods of up to 18 months. If you use such transfers strategically,  he says, you can lower the rate on your car loan, saving as much as $1,000 in interest charges."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06EEDC123BF930A15750C0A9659D8B63

MetroPCS’s chief executive, Roger D. Linquist, left, said in a letter that the complex merger, which would give existing investors a 26 percent stake in the combined company, was the best possible option for shareholders. Mr. Linquist added that the company had considered various alternatives, but concluded that it would best grow by becoming the top low-cost cellphone service company in the country."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE3D91238F930A25750C0A9659D8B63
In Spinoffs, a Chance to Jettison Undesirable Liabilities	"A spinoff is a product of Wall Street math that says one plus one can equal three. Yet as shareholders of Time Warner may be about to find out, it can also be all about subtraction, as a company ditches an unwanted business, in this case, magazines.
 
The business argument for a spinoff is typically that a separation of the assets allows both the former parent and the newly independent company to be better run, freeing management to take bolder steps with the new company. And because Wall Street is a place where magic works, the market will recognize this, giving each of the separated companies a higher price."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E0DC1238F930A25750C0A9659D8B63

Britain Is Expected to Urge Europe to Relax Proposed Restrictions on Bankers&#x2019; Bonuses	"BRUSSELS — The British finance minister, George Osborne, is expected Tuesday to urge his European Union counterparts to water down proposed rules restricting the size of bankers’ bonuses.

A report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations highlights flaws in the bank’s public disclosures and takes aim at several executives, including Douglas Braunstein, who was chief financial officer at the time of the losses, according to people briefed on the inquiry. The report’s findings — scheduled to be released on March 15 — are expected to fault the executives for allowing JPMorgan to build the bets without fully warning regulators and investors, these people said."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE0DE1639F936A35750C0A9659D8B63

Popular Demand	"Car sales increased 3.7 percent from February 2012 to last month, according to Autodata, a research firm. Popular vehicles included smaller cars like the Ford Fusion and the Dodge Dart, pickup trucks like G.M.’s Chevrolet Silverado, and S.U.V.’s like Toyota’s RAV4. 
 
A look at Edmunds.com shows what consumers are interested in, or intending to buy. While Honda saw sales drop 2 percent year-over-year in February, and Nissan’s sales fell 6.6 percent, people are reading about its cars: three Hondas, including the Civic, above, were high on the list, along with two Nissan models.

Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo uncovered the foreclosures while analyzing mortgages as part of a multibillion-dollar settlement deal with federal authorities, according to people with direct knowledge of the findings. In January, regulators ordered the banks to identify military members and other borrowers who were evicted in violation of federal law."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E2DF1E30F937A35750C0A9659D8B63

Up to now, the focus on the power and implications of Big Data technology has been involved social media, business decision-making and online privacy. Those are big subjects in their own right. So it’s not surprising that the notion of a data-driven society has not been much considered."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E3D81231F937A35750C0A9659D8B63

Both companies recently made their seasonal practices of matching prices at online retailers a year-round policy.
 
A new study of Amazon customers who research products in stores by Placed , a mobile analytics company, offers some insight into who else could be at the greatest risk of losing business to showrooming. The study relies on Placed’s panel of more than 14,000 mobile phone users who consent to have their locations tracked in exchange for store gift cards and other perks. Placed can tell when those people visit a particular retailer without them having to proactively report their store visits."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEFDA1F31F937A35750C0A9659D8B63

Hello, I Must Be Going	"Andrew Mason, founder of the daily deals site Groupon, is a big goof. He was booted last week as chief executive, but didn’t let it cramp his style. Mr. Mason’s resignation letter, which he tweeted under the entirely reasonable notion that it would leak anyway, said he was leaving to spend more time with his family, the age-old alibi of dismissed chiefs everywhere. Then he came clean: “Just kidding — I was fired today.”
 
Mr. Mason added a dose of humor to what many can only hope will be a new kind of corporate goodbye: the honest one. Carol Bartz, a former Yahoo chief, was a pioneer of this approach. “I’ve just been fired,” she told her staff in 2011, a comment that won her more respect than anything else in her brief tenure."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E6D91030F930A35750C0A9659D8B63

Unshakable Payday Loans	"People use payday loans to avoid borrowing from family and friends, and to avoid cutting back further on expenses. But they often end up doing those things anyway to pay back the loan, a new report finds.
 
The average payday loan — a short-term, high-interest-rate loan typically secured by a borrower’s future paycheck — requires a repayment of more than $400 in two weeks, according to a new report from an arm of the Pew Charitable Trusts. But the average borrower can only afford a $50 payment, which means that borrowers end up rolling over the loan and adding to their debt. The Pew report found that borrowers typically experience prolonged periods of debt, paying more than $500 in fees over five months."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E6DE1F31F931A35750C0A9659D8B63

Calling Nook sales over the holiday period an “obvious disappointment,” the bookseller’s chief executive, William Lynch, said the company was taking “significant actions to right size investments” in its digital hardware division through steep cuts in advertising and the manufacturing of devices. Mr. Lynch made his remarks in a conference call with analysts shortly after Barnes & Noble reported a 26 percent decline in the fiscal third quarter for the Nook segment, which includes digital tablets and e-readers."	http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E1DE1730F932A35750C0A9659D8B63
