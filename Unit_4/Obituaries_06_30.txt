Dr. Charles C. Edwards, Influential F.D.A.

Dr. Edwards, who had been appointed commissioner by President Richard M. Nixon in 1969, ordered the review of hundreds of thousands of prescription and over-the-counter drugs.

While Mr. Marshall admitted he was with his friend during that encounter, he withdrew an earlier admission that they were trying to rob the elderly man; Mr. Marshall was never charged with robbery. The obituary also misstated a change in rules of evidence resulting from the case. The prosecution must now fully disclose to the defense any evidence it has; the defense must ensure that full disclosure from the prosecution takes place, and must fully disclose its own evidence only in establishing alibis.

Corrections	An obituary on Wednesday about Mark R. Rosenzweig, a research psychologist and brain researcher, misstated the year he received the American Psychological Association&#8217;s Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award. It was 1982, not 1998.	http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/14/obituaries/14corrections-05.html
Corrections	An obituary on Aug. 5 about the Modernist architect Charles Gwathmey was erroneously corrected in this space on Tuesday. As the obituary correctly noted, Mr. Gwathmey began college at the University of Pennsylvania and then transferred as an undergraduate to Yale, from which he graduated with a master&#8217;s degree in architecture in 1962. He did not, as the correction said, earn a bachelor&#8217;s degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1961.	http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/14/obituaries/14corrections-04.html

Corrections	A picture on Thursday with an obituary about Nikolaos Makarezos, one of the three ringleaders of the military coup that overthrew the democratic government of Greece in 1967, was published in error. The photograph showed Stylianos Pattakos, the last survivor of the three &#151; not Mr. Makarezos.	http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/obituaries/07corrections-08.html
Corrections	An obituary on July 18 about Walter Cronkite, using information from his autobiography, “A Reporter’s Life,” misstated the origin of the term “anchor.” While Mr. Cronkite was referred to as the anchor of CBS news coverage of the 1952 presidential conventions, that was not the first time that “anchor” and “anchorman” were used. Both terms had been applied to broadcasters in other contexts before the conventions. The obituary also included an erroneous anecdote from the autobiography about the extent of his fame. He was said to be so widely known that newscasters in Sweden were once called “Cronkiters,” but that term is not known to linguists in that country.	http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/obituaries/06corrections-08.html
